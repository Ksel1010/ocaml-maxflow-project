# Ocaml MaxFlow Project
## Features 
* Graph algorithms:
   - this project functions such as find_path, graphFlow, graphEcart and minFlow
  
* Graph visualization:
  - this project permits the representation of a graph in a .svg file to facilitate its visualization
* Graph manipulation:
  - utility functions for manipulating the graphs
* Direct cycle removing:
  - functionnality of removing direct cycles in a graph 
## How to use
* Installation:
  - make sure OCaml, Dune and Graphviz are installed on your machine
  - clone this repository
* Compilation:
  - use the `make build` to compile. This creates an `ftest.exe` executable
* Running:
  - use the `make demo` to run the `ftest` program with some arguments
  

## Conclusion 
This project provides a basic implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to solve the maximum flow problem in a flow network. The functions provided allow manipulation of directed graphs, including handling arcs, removing cycles, and computing the maximum flow between two nodes.
